## Assumptions ##
There was no requirement around what type the longest and shortest word functions should return. Consequently I have assumed that an array is accecptable.

## Running the tests ##
In order to run the tests run the below series of command from the root directory of the project:
1) 'npm install' - This will install all the necessary dependencies.
2) 'npm test' - This will run the tests.
